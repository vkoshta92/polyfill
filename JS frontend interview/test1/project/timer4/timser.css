/* This line of code is using the conditional (ternary) operator in JavaScript to create a string variable formattedSeconds that displays the seconds value with leading zeros if the value is less than 10, and without leading zeros if it is 10 or greater.

The conditional operator has the following syntax: condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse.

In this case, the condition is seconds < 10. If this condition is true (i.e. the seconds value is less than 10), the expression before the : is evaluated, which is a string template literal that includes a leading zero and the value of the seconds variable. If the condition is false (i.e. the seconds value is 10 or greater), the expression after the : is evaluated, which is simply the value of the seconds variable.

For example, if the seconds variable has a value of 5, the expression seconds < 10 is true, so the formattedSeconds variable will be set to the string "05". If the seconds variable has a value of 15, the expression seconds < 10 is false, so the formattedSeconds variable will be set to the string "15" (without a leading zero).

This technique is commonly used in timer and clock applications to display time values with leading zeros for consistency and readability.
